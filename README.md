# vim-github-markdown

**WIP**: This is my attempt at creating Github Flavored Markdown syntax support for Vim.

## Why?

I could not find a syntax file that matched my expectations for Github Flavored Markdown.

I also wanted to learn how to write a Vim Plugin.

# TODO

* [x] Support ATX Headings
* [x] Support Setext Headings
* [ ] Support Fenced Code Blocks
* [ ] Support Tables
